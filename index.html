    Hello, I’m Alex.
</p>

<p class="anim" style="--delay: .1s">
    I’m a Digital Forensics student (M.Sc.) from Germany and I enjoy combining code and design. It fascinates me to create something out of nothing. My passion is to create useful and elegant software with dedication and an eye for detail.
</p>

<p class="anim" style="--delay: .2s">
    My tools of choice are mainly from the open source area and include <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, <a href="https://tauri.app/">Tauri</a> and <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> among many others.
