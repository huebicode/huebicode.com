<p>I had a few photos on my Pixel phone that I wanted to edit, so it was time to deal with RAW converters. As impressive as the scope of <a href="https://rawtherapee.com/">RawTherapee</a> was, I ended up with <a href="https://www.darktable.org/">Darktable</a>. For me, Darktable was more intuitive and allowed me to quickly achieve my desired photo look.</p>
