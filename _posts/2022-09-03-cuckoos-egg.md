This book from Cliff Stoll was always at the end of my reading queue, because Infosec is a fast paced area and what should I learn from an over 35 year old incident? Actually this book aged very well and is still relevant in this area. It describes basically the beginnings of DFIR.

On the German side the case is better known because of the events surrounding the KGB hacks and the death of the hacker Karl Koch, which were made into a movie and a book.
