<p>This book from Cliff Stoll was always at the end of my reading queue. Infosec is a fast paced area and what should I learn from an over 35 year old incident? Actually this book aged very well and is still relevant in this area. It describes basically the beginnings of DFIR.</p>

<p>On the German side the case is better known because of the events surrounding the KGB hacks and the death of the hacker <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Koch_(Hacker)">Karl Koch</a>, which were made into a movie<sup><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> and a book<sup><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>.</p>
