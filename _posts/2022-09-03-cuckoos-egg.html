<p>This book from Cliff Stoll was always at the end of my reading queue, because Infosec is a fast paced area and what should I learn from an over 35 year old incident? Actually this book aged very well and is still relevant in this area. It describes basically the beginnings of DFIR.</p>
<p>On the German side the case is better known because of the events surrounding the KGB hacks and the death of the hacker Karl Koch, which were made into a movie1 and a book2.</p>
